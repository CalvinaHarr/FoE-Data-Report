        <h1>Data and Modeling Report</h1>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This data is from 5,000 people representative of the nation's population. 
            They are located in many counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.  
            The data distinguishes these demographics by ethnicity (i.e. asking if they have Hispanic origin), age, 
            6-month time period in which the examination was done, gender, and more. The people were taken through an interview and physical examination. The interview portion asked questions regarding socioeconomic and dietary status. The examination portion consists of medical, dental, and physiological tests run by highly trained professionals. 
            The purpose of compiling this data is to assess the health and nutritional 
            status of adults and children across the United States. 
            Findings from the data can be used to find what diseases may be most prevalent. 
            They are also used to determine associations between nutrition status as it correlates with disease prevention. 
            With this data, it can also be found the national standards for height, weight, and blood pressure. 
            An understanding of why the data was collected is important because if we know the purpose of the data, it makes more sense.
        </p>
        <h3>Systems</h3>
        <p>
            This data collection was compiled by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2013 to 2014. It is a general examination of the health and nutritional statuses of different people. The institution responsible for it was the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). One group of people that can be called stakeholders for this study are the subjects of the survey. The subjects of this study are the 5,000 American citizens representing the United States. Other stakeholders include healthcare providers. A specific example of this is how pediatricians use the data from these examinations and reference them as a national standard for growth in children. Another group of stakeholders are policymakers, specifically the Food and Drug Administration. They use these findings to decide if they need to change vitamin and mineral regulations for the nation’s food supply. 
        </p>
        <h3>Additional Data</h3>
        <p>
            Additional information that could prove useful to the stakeholders is an account of physical activity from the subjects. The survey could collect this information by asking the subjects how often they exercise, rating by how many times a week they had exercised within the last month or so of taking the survey. They could add onto this piece of information by asking about the intensity of exercise each week. For example, if someone goes on walks every day, they could report lower intensity than someone who runs every other day. Another useful piece of data to add would be how much time the subjects spend watching TV or being on their phone. This could be as simple as asking how many hours the subjects spend on their phone. This would be helpful in determining how these habits correlate with the other health aspects shown in the data.
