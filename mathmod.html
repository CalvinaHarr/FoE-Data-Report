        <h1>Mathematical Model</h1>
        <a href="index.html">back</a>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The relationship between height and blood pressure has the line of best fit with coefficients m=0.4426 and b=-3.801 (the equation being 0.4426*height-3.801) which means as height increases by one cm the blood pressure level increases by 0.4426 mmHg.
        </p>
        <h3>Accuracy of Model</h3>
        <p>
            At first the data starts off dispersed and non-linear and then it curves almost exponentially and then the data becomes more closely fit together. I feel like the data, especially after the 140cm mark becomes more easy to predict, especially with the line of best fit. The line of best fit is probably a little skewed because the data is not all in a linear format so it may be a poor descriptor of the fit.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusions:</h3>
        <p>
            As height increases so does the probability of higher blood pressure. It can be  concluded that as height increases so too does blood pressure. Because in this study women were on average taller than men, it can also be concluded that the women in the study will on average have higher blood pressure than men.
        </p>
        <h3>Potential Misinterpretations:</h3>
        <p>
            It is possible that someone could misinterpret the model to mean that someone with high blood pressure must be tall or that someone that is tall must have high blood pressure. It is more accurate to say that someone that is tall has a higher likelihood of also having high blood pressure. Also, the use of bar graphs somewhat oversimplifies the data and makes it less clear how common outliers are in the data set.
        </p>   

        <h3>Potential Decisions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The model shows correlation between height and blood pressure, so taller people might choose to be more careful with their diet.
            </li>
            <li>The model shows correlation between height and blood pressure, so shorter people might not give as much thought to their diet.
            </li>
        </ul>
